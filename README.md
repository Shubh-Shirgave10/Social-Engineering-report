# Social-Engineering-report
## Introduction

Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. These attacks are often the initial entry point for larger cyberattacks.


## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. Phishing

Phishing involves sending fraudulent messages that appear to come from a trusted source. It’s often used to steal login credentials or distribute malware.

**Common forms:**
- Email phishing
- Spear phishing (targeted)
- Smishing (SMS phishing)
- Vishing (voice phishing)

### 2. Pretexting

Pretexting is the act of creating a fabricated scenario to trick a victim into revealing sensitive information. Attackers often pose as officials, tech support, or HR personnel.

### 3. Baiting

Baiting lures victims with false promises or items of interest (e.g., free software, USB drives infected with malware) to get them to install malicious software or reveal credentials.

### 4. Tailgating

Also known as "piggybacking", tailgating occurs when an unauthorized person gains physical access to a secure area by following an authorized user.

### 5. Quid Pro Quo

Attackers offer a service or benefit in exchange for information. A common example includes a fake IT technician offering to fix issues in exchange for login credentials.



## Case Studies

### 1. Google and Facebook Phishing Scam (2013–2015)

A Lithuanian man impersonated a Taiwanese hardware company and tricked Google and Facebook into transferring over **$100 million** via fake invoices and phishing emails.

**Impact:** Huge financial loss. Both companies cooperated with law enforcement to recover funds.

### 2. RSA Security Breach (2011)

RSA, a major cybersecurity firm, fell victim to a phishing email with a malicious Excel attachment. Attackers exploited this to breach SecurID two-factor authentication tokens used by thousands of companies.

**Impact:** Compromised security systems of multiple defense contractors.

### 3. Ubiquiti Networks BEC Attack (2015)

Cybercriminals used a **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** attack to impersonate executives and trick employees into wiring **$46.7 million** to fraudulent accounts.

**Impact:** Massive financial loss and reputational damage.



## Preventive Measures and Recommendations

### 1. **Security Awareness Training**
- Regularly educate employees on identifying and avoiding phishing, pretexting, and baiting techniques.

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Even if credentials are stolen, MFA adds a layer of defense.

### 3. **Email Filtering and Spam Detection**
- Use advanced email filters to detect and quarantine phishing emails.

### 4. **Incident Response Plan**
- Have a clear protocol for reporting and responding to suspected social engineering attempts.

### 5. **Access Controls**
- Restrict access to sensitive data and enforce the principle of least privilege.

### 6. **Simulated Attacks**
- Run periodic social engineering simulations to test employee vigilance.


## Conclusion

Social engineering attacks continue to be a significant cybersecurity threat, targeting the human element rather than technical flaws. Organizations must proactively educate employees, implement robust security policies, and prepare to respond quickly to incidents. Awareness, vigilance, and layered defenses are essential to mitigate these attacks.
